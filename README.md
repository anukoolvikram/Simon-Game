# Simon Game

A simple Simon game implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript/jQuery.

## Description

Simon is a memory game where the player must replicate the sequence of colored buttons that the game presents. The game starts with a level title, and the player needs to press a key to start. The game then shows a sequence of colored buttons, and the player must replicate the sequence by clicking on the buttons.

## How to Play

1. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.

2. The game will display the title "Press A Key to Start."

3. Press any key to start the game.

4. The game will show a sequence of colored buttons.

5. Replicate the sequence by clicking on the buttons in the same order.

6. If the sequence is correct, the game will advance to the next level.

7. If the sequence is incorrect, the game will end, and the title will change to "Game Over."
